```

After installation the app is located inside `/Applications/InstantSpaceSwitcher.app`


### Downloads

Pre-built binaries are available through Github Releases [here](https://github.com/jurplel/InstantSpaceSwitcher/tags).

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jurplel/InstantSpaceSwitcher
cd InstantSpaceSwitcher
./dist/build.sh
open ./build/InstantSpaceSwitcher.app
```

### Troubleshooting / First time startup

When opening the app the first time you are likely to run into any of the following warnings:

> "Apple could not verify InstantSpaceSwitcher.app is free of malware"

> "App is damaged and can’t be opened"

> "App can't be opened because the developer cannot be verified"

Please follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Open_unsigned_applications_on_macOS_Sequoia_and_newer) for instructions on how to allow the app to run[^1].

Afterward you will get a warning that InstantSpaceSwitcher wants to use accessibility features. You have to allow this.

## Background
When I first bought a high refresh rate monitor, around ~2018, I could tell that the space switching animation was longer because it had scaled with the refresh rate. Because of this, I eventually stopped using spaces altogether, and have been looking for a solution ever since. 

The workaround in this project is to create a synthetic trackpad gesture with an artificially high velocity. This effectively skips the animation.

If you work at Apple, and your team owns the space switching animation, please fix this long-standing bug[^2] (and let us disable the animation natively, please).

[^1]: This happens because the app is not signed, which requires a costly Apple Developer account
[^2]: And I know for a fact there is a rdar for this
